# Contribute to the Centreon Stream Connectors project

## How to contribute

There are many ways you can contribute to this project and everyone should be able to help in its own way.

### For code lovers

You can work on Stream Connectors

- Create a new stream connector
- Update an existing stream connector
- [Fix issues](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-stream-connector-scripts/issues)

You can improve our Lua modules 

- Add a new module
  - Comment it
  - Document it
  - *optional* Provide usage examples
- Update an existing module
  - Update the documentation (if it changes the input and/or output of a method)
  - Update usage examples if there are any and if they are impacted by the change

### For everybody 

Since we are not all found of code, there are still ways to be part of this project

- Open issues for bugs or feedbacks (or help people)
- Update an already existing example or provide new ones

## Code guidelines

If you want to work on our LUA modules, you must follow the coding style provided by luarocks
[Coding style guidelines](https://github.com/luarocks/lua-style-guide)

While it is mandatory to follow those guidelines for modules, they will not be enforced on community powered Stream Connectors scripts.
It is however recommened to follow them as much as possible. 

## Documentations

When creating a module you must comment your methods as follow 

```lua
--- This is a local function that does things
-- @param first_name (string) the first name 
-- @param last_name (string) the last name
-- @return age (number) the age of the person
local function get_age(first_name, last_name)
  -- some code --
end
```

You should comment complicated or long code blocks to help people review your code. 

It is also required to create or update the module documentation for a more casual reading to help people use your module in their Stream Connector
